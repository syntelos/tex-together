We were born twins out of a galactic collision.  We tell or say absolutely anything to each other, in private.  We share a confidence inviolable.  It is less an invention and more a demand we place each on the other.  What I need from you I know I will get from you, contained in that inviolable spiritual ether of the subjective metaphysical dynamic of the infinite love of the internal fountain of energy.
