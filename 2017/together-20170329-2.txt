On that journey, the path of the bear, my mind was lost to the stars.  With gravel in my eyes I looked in every direction for a method of self preservation.  I looked to the forest by imagining, and found that my level of consciousness was more powerful than my level of intellect.  I went to the spirit world, following the ancestors, and found friends there.  Eventually I returned from the path of the bear as my psychological state of being accepted the place I found itself in.
