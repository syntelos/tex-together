We have established the knowing of knowledge, the sense of language,
the finding of comprehension, and the holding of belief.

The language of mathematics combines the disciplines of learning with
the senses for the suspension and discovery of meaning to discreet
points.

The languages of art combines the disciplines of learning with the
senses for the suspension and discovery of meaning to continuous lines
and threads.
