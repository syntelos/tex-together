have you been creepy to me?  almost.  the sights are there.  but i
can't take it too seriously because it's too weird.  so i assume you
know what you're doing.  i ignore it.  don't know what to do and
ignore it.  probably been making me ill.

guess that's what gets me going in a thousand directions.  trying to
support some unknown unknown whatever i don't know conceits or
cleverness or department of environmental protection air cleaning

i guess that's the understanding, DEP
