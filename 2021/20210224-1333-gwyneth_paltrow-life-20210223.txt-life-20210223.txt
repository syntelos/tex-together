This year, I’ve been working with my dear friend and functional medicine practitioner @drwillcole and experimenting with the program from his new book, Intuitive Fasting. Will's clear, but flexible, four-week plan combines intuitive eating with intermittent fasting and Ketotarian foods. It's designed to optimize our well-being and set us up to feel our best for all the other weeks to come. This is not a book of dogma. It will not punish you or restrict you. If there’s anything difficult in these pages, it is Will’s request that we be willing to listen to ourselves, to our own bodies, to our intuition. @drwillcole, thank you for guiding me and for helping me feel my best in a long time. I can’t wait for you all to read Intuitive Fasting and experience Will’s magic, too.
