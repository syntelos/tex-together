What a wonderful day! Thank you to Buncombe County Health Department and Emergency Services staff and volunteers and Haywood Street staff and companions. Over 200 people received COVID vaccinations. And the Downtown Welcome Table served up 500 prime rib meals complete with salad, baked potato, and strawberry dream cake. Abundant grace indeed!
