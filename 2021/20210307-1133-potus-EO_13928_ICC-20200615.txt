  LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR BLOCKING PROPERTY OF CERTAIN PERSONS ASSOCIATED
  WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT SANCTIONS

    The Blocking Property of Certain Persons Associated with the
    International Criminal Court Sanctions program represents the
    implementation of multiple legal authorities.  Some of these
    authorities are in the form of an executive order issued by the
    President. Other authorities are public laws (statutes) passed by
    The Congress. These authorities are further codified by OFAC in its
    regulations which are published the Code of Federal Regulations
    (CFR).
