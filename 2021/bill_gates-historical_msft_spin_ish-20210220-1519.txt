Meaningful action from business leaders will require the courage to take risks that many companies aren't used to taking.

Are there things businesses can do to make a measurable difference for the climate? @Billgates thinks so. ‘But they will not come easily’ he warns in his green manifesto, published on @FTlifearts


I'm reading a sparknotes summation of an available commentary on Microsoft's historical style of market leading & making.  Since I'm not familiar with the conversation, but have witnessed the causation, and understand the vitality of the subject.  I haven't seen the "market making marketing" style (I'll call it) for a number of years.  But the issue arose due to our free space optical work with government.

Of course it's an undesireable behavior for an enterprise to engage in what we must compare to disinformation as the ambiguation of terminology due to market informational territorialism.  In the past it was called "FUD" (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and (again) seems to be an historical footnote in the "information machinery" (re "ACM") industry.

Thanks to @andersoncooper, @SeaArtsLectures, and everyone who joined our virtual conversation about climate change. Great to have so much support from my hometown for this important work.

Gates' optical seems to be a "black eye" assertion of defense, which leads me to an enterprise management complexity argument.  


The observation will serve my purpose to recognize the threads of our free space optical work with government (and law).  As an information machinery veteran, I'm not unfamiliar with the attention Gates deals with, which is vital to our free space optical efforts on behalf of society and government.  

The subject contrasts starkly with the conception of metaphysical computing (raised under label "metalog").  Like numerical computing, "garbage in, garbage out".  But with fancier "garbage" (i.e. "it's your information, if you don't comprehend it no one will").  A problem handled by "metalog" tools.  A concept begging for a hardware solution.  (IMHO)

The novelty of the departure is not unlike the introduction of information machinery.  And this has relevance to many efforts on behalf of society and government to ensure a sustainable future.
