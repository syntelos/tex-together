\input shorts

It occurs to me that this makes sense.  How else could one eat belgian
waffles if not topped with eggs benedict.  And I am aware that this
makes no sense.  When either plate is compared, their\ independence\ 
screams at me.  However, it is precisely that independence which
confounds me.
