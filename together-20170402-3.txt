Boys, at least this one, grow up with the expectation that a wedding is an emotional white out.  Devastating.  And by natural implication, to be avoided at all costs.  Girls, by all accounts, grow up expecting to survive such events.


We’ve been dreaming of our wedding.  I’ve been dreaming of carrying my babies around on my back in a papoose.  My wife, a famous actor and performer, has a serious talent for programming my dreams.  Of course, I’m extremely open to her suggestions, being in love with her.  Dreams of the experiential categories are common in this context.  I avoid speaking for her, complicated business, that.  But it’s my understanding that she’s in, well over her head, as well.
