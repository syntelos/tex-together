Gwyneth's story board tells her story, weaving our story into her
fabric in the split screen of ``not quite here, yet''.  It is a form
of projection, ``on her back''.  

From such positions we fight for the existence of the life of a
subjective language.  We propose a voice.

We each have relationships that can benefit from this care, as well as
our own.
