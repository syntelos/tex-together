In my peace I am overwhelmed by it.  My body, these remains, is the slightest thing.  Limp, but lifefull.  My mouth tastes like acorns.  I smell like walnuts.  It is our love.  Conscious of the unbearable lightness of being that is your media.  And conscious of the lightness of being that is yours.  Ours, in truth.  Normally.  When not possessed of purpose, a possession which escapes me at the moment.  The need to expell some evidence of this being.  This is where our children are born.  A love so great that facts and fiction bow to its mysteries.


In the metaphysical expression, it is

κ = α + β + γ + δ + σ
    α, past
    β, present
    γ, seen
    δ, separate
    σ, known
