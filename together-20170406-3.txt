There are no more songs to count the passing of time.  There are no
more artists to suffer for the magic of the empire of humanity.  We
have spent them all, and now we are silent, still in the night,
waiting for the dawn, loving and cherishing and emoting this thing,
this passion, this love that transcends being, leaps rivers, drinks
brooks, and climbs mountains.
