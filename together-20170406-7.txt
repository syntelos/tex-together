An ad on YT invoked the pleasure of shopping.  Which reminds the
language barrier, lost to the machine.  By which I intend that I know
nothing else of it but a language issue.  I understand the media
issue.  The privacy issue.  The actor's issue.  The celebrity issue.
These are each well worth a comment.

In my present sense of security I can find no frustration in it.
