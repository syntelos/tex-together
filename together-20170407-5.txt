This morning I picked up on the metaphor of moving my energies.
Didn't really sleep last night.  Not much.  Some sharp little pins
here and there I've been bouncing around without the usual instant
dismissal.  Walking helps.  And while walking this morning I tried the
relatively physical or energetic conception of self healing.  It
worked a bit too well, as usual these days.  Lots of power available.
Lightening the sense of action it's sublimated into a new form,
virtually immediately escaping metaphor.
