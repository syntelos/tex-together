you read my energies (as well as the oddities of coincidence that keep
me moving)

whenever i'm writing or sleeping i'm with you

missing you, living with not missing you tooooo much

sometimes i have to keep some distance because the entanglement
energies are too large (me dealing, in my porpoising, as always)
