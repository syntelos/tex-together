if there's something about the "rules" and "games" stuff, i don't see
anything to it, it's sillyness, right

makes people around me nutty

i don't know what to take from that, actually

which is a pretty big subject

what on earth are you up to with all that

sometimes i see this and that, and it's as easily forgotten, some huge
web of conceits that paint pictures

just that you're talking to me

that's the understanding

and then, what should i say, really

which, of course, i've been pretty nutty

so on that score i can only admit my craziness trying to deal
