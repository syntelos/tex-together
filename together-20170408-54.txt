i'm too pushy, from your perspective.  me, i haven't really thought it
through very far, not having found the state of mind and perspective
in the same place.  So much has struck me as crazy talk for so long
that I've lost whatever I ever might have had that would have been
useful in this situation.  And then, there's more than one reason for
that.  But, that's me.  You want me to focus, perhaps translate / edit
/ correct sequences.  Perhaps presentation display "publishing" steps.
I have no clue where we're going with this.  I've been so despertate
to right my sinking ship that I'm only just beginning to get a
"terrestrial" sense of reason.

Remember having seen a branch leading to a funny intersection at
"conceit" and "girl", but lost it.  Some good kind of "oh, don't
even".

As usual, there's plenty I won't write.  

More to the point, slower translation services.

Oh, my aching head.  How long has it been I've been in this crazy
world? (Cabo San Lucas?)
