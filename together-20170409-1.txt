Gwyneth’s public life, rather the carefully manicured public aspect of Gwyneth’s life, includes a relatively extraordinary degree and kind of disclosure.   She discusses issues of personal concern including health, life, commitment, courage, and justice in a variety of languages of media and opacity.  She enjoys the first principle of language, that intent is removed from expression by reflection, and applies it judiciously to her communication.


At the moment we find ourselves challenged by circumstances that are extraordinarily sensitive and complex, rewarding and tedious.  


Naturally, my own experience and interests have intersected with hers with objects and associations that are related and unrelated in a variety of ways.  A reasonable reader will recognize principles of expression including context and form, transparency and opacity, tense and stress, significance and substance, and association and independence, as well as a fairly conventional sense of right and wrong, reasonable and unreasonable, intelligible and unintelligible, and probable and improbable.


The greatest challenge we face as publishers is the unusual and extraordinary interpretation of relatively pedantic and straightforward communication.  


A sense of culture and society and justice is welcome, while a sense of politics and business is limited to a very conventional, relatively conservative, and most importantly, individual scale of rights and appreciation.
