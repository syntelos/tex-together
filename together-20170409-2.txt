Together, we ascend through the heavens into the metaphysical spaces of the ascended.


Through each expression, high or low, we modulate our shared faith and commitment of act, word and deed, that we may correct our errors, refine our messages, communicate our desires, and make clear our intentions.


We have employed these purposes to ways and means that serve this purpose, this marriage made in the heavens of our souls, physical and metaphysical.
